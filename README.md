# incremental_change_data_capture
# Documentation

## Overview

This project is a data pipeline project that focuses on extracting, transforming, and loading asset data obtained from an external API. This documentation provides an overview of the project's structure, components, and how to get started.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories and files:

1. **cointains the base config file**: This directory (or file) likely contains configuration settings or files related to the base configuration of the project. Specific details may vary depending on the project's requirements.

2. **asset_data**: This directory contains the asset data in the form of CSV files. These CSV files are typically downloaded from an external API and serve as the source data for the ETL pipeline.

3. **flows**: The "flows" directory contains Python scripts responsible for the ETL process. These scripts perform data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks. You can explore these scripts to understand the data processing workflow.

4. **.gitignore**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control. It helps keep the repository clean by excluding files that don't need to be tracked, such as temporary files, build artifacts, and sensitive data.

5. **.prefectignore**: This file is used in conjunction with Prefect, a workflow automation and scheduling library. It specifies which files or directories should be ignored by Prefect when defining and executing workflows.

6. **Extract_Load_transform-deployment.yaml**: This YAML file contains deployment configurations for deploying the ETL pipeline or related components. The specific deployment details may vary based on the project's architecture and technologies used.

7. **README.md**: This is the project's README file, which provides documentation and information about the project. It includes details about the project's purpose, setup instructions, execution guidelines, and other relevant information.

8. **debezium.json**: This file contains Debezium configuration settings. Debezium is a change data capture (CDC) platform used for monitoring and capturing changes in databases. This configuration file defines which databases to monitor and how to capture data changes.

9. **docker-compose.yaml**: This YAML file is used with Docker Compose to define and run multiple Docker containers as part of the project. It may define containers related to Kafka, Debezium, or other components required for the project's operation.
